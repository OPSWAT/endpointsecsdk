## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Workflow

1. **Download the SDK Libraries**
   Run the downloader to fetch all SDK binaries and header files.

   ```powershell
   cd OPSWAT-SDK-Downloader\C-Sharp\bin
   .\SDKDownloader.exe
   ```

2. **Pick a Sample**
   Choose a relevant sample depending on your target language or platform. Examples:

   * `HelloWorld-CPP` ‚Üí for C++
   * `VAPM-Scanner` ‚Üí for vulnerability scanning
   * `language-examples/go` ‚Üí for Go

3. **Build the Sample**

   * Windows: run PowerShell build scripts (`build.ps1`)
   * Linux/macOS: use provided Makefiles or `cmake`

4. **Run and Test**
   Execute the built sample to validate SDK setup and integration.

## üß† Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Possible Fix                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SDK not found                  | Verify SDKDownloader completed successfully and `libs` folder exists |
| Permission denied              | Run PowerShell as Administrator or use `sudo` on Unix systems        |
| Build fails on missing headers | Check `inc` folder placement and environment paths                   |
